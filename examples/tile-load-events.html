title: Tile Load Events
shortdesc: Example using tile load events.
docs: >
  <p>Image tile sources fire events related to tile loading.  You can
  listen for <code>tileloadstart</code>, <code>tileloadend</code>,
  and <code>tileloaderror</code> type events to monitor tile loading
  progress.  This example registers listeners for these events and
  renders a tile loading progress bar at the bottom of the map.</p>
  <p>Be ware - difference between <code>tileloadstart</code> and
  (<code>tileloadend</code> + <code>tileloaderror</code>) might reach
  <em>0</em> before all tiles have been loaded due to queuing.  This
  could be the case if tile count is large or there are several layers.
  This shortcoming can be mitigated by querying if all map tiles have
  been loaded after each <code>postrender</code> event.</p>
